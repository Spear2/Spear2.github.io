            In a world where hunters, human warriors who possess magical abilities, must battle deadly 
            monsters to protect mankind from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung 
            Jinwoo finds himself in a seemingly endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly 
            surviving an overwhelmingly powerful dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious 
            program called the System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the extremely rare 
            ability to level up in strength, possibly beyond any known limits. Follow Jinwoo's journey as he fights 
            against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true 
            source of his powers.
